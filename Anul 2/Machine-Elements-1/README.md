## How to understand the project
Basically do the calculations presented in the course pdf step by step. Eventually you will get there. Some people have achieved getting to the result by doing it on paper. Mathcad is also an option. In the resurse tab, you will find my own initial project. ATTENTION! It is not entirely correct, but it should provide you with 90% of the image of what the project is, what the project means and so on. Modern solutions such as Mathcad and Excel are not seen in high regards, thus try to write by hand EVERYTHING you do on Mathcad and Excel if you choose to walk on this path.
